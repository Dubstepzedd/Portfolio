# Portfolio  

## Why?  

I wanted to create a page that showcases my prior experience, projects, and other details about me. Instead of just listing my work, I wanted a dynamic and interactive way to present my journey, skills, and achievements.  

I decided to build a classic **portfolio** website in **React**, as it aligns with modern web development trends and offers the flexibility to create a highly responsive and engaging user experience. React is also a framework I've been eager to explore in greater depth, making this project both a showcase of my work and a learning opportunity.  

### Goals  

By developing this portfolio, I aim to:  

- **Gain hands-on experience** with React, including component-based architecture and state management.  
- **Improve UI/UX skills** by designing an intuitive and visually appealing interface.  
- **Create a centralized platform** to display my skills, projects, and background for potential employers, collaborators, or anyone interested in my work.  

This portfolio is more than just a collection of projects‚Äîit's a **reflection of my growth** as a developer and my passion for building engaging web applications.
